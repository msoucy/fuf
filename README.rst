Various function-related manipulators

This is meant to be a relatively simple library that adds support for miscellaneous tricks with functions.

Some of the tools include:

- Overload sets with argument constraints
- A slightly-improved version of functools.wraps, which also copies the signature of the function
- Set of functions that gets dispatched based on the first argument - proof of concept
- A dictionary class that dispatches to another dictionary if a lookup fails

Supports Python 2 and 3, though improvements, tests, and fixes are more than welcome.
